 <h2>AFR Rich List 2019: Anthony Pratt is Australia's wealthiest person</h2>

 <br>
Paper and packaging tycoon Anthony Pratt has been named Australia's wealthiest person for the third-straight year.<br>

<p>The Visy Industries boss tops the 2019 Australian Financial Review Rich List with a fortune of $15.57 billion, up from $12.9 billion last year.</p><br>

<p> Mr Pratt is followed by mining magnate Gina Rinehart ($13.8 billion) and veteran property developer Harry Triguboff ($13.54 billion), who have traded places at No.2 and No.3 this year</p>


"A lot of Prattâ€™s business is in the US, so he's been helped out by the corporate tax cuts and instant asset write-offs that Trump has brought in," Rich List editor Michael Bailey told 9Finance.</p>


<p>"Trump's cut the corporate tax rate to 21 per cent and allowed you to write off all your investments in your business in the first year.

"Pratt's invested a lot back in his business already but now he's getting rewarded more handsomely for it in terms of paying less tax.

"That's supercharged his profits this year and that's why he's so far ahead."</p>
